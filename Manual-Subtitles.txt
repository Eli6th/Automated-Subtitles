On the left side, is the transition radiation detector, followed by nine-layer of silicon tracker, followed by electromagnetic calorimeter, and then rain imaging cherenkov called RICH, a magnet, and then time of flight detector. 
In total, a third of a million electronic channels, 650 fast microprocessors, and this would develop specially by the laboratory of nuclear science of MIT. It has a dimension of 5 meters by 4 meters by 3 meters. It weighs 7.5 tons. 

The detectors can be broken into 5 classes. Each class, if you look horizontally, goes through the different particles, with different trace. So, each particle is identified five times, for whatever redundance. 
So If you look vertically, the electron, also TRD, flight tracker, these you don’t need to know, but if this trace proton ion positron, antiproton, antihelium, all these different traces. 
You measure the momentum, the units are billion electronvolt. Charge is the location and the periodic table, or the number of protons in the nucleus. Rigidity is a special term used in space, means momentum per unit charged. 
Energy, E: billion electron volts per number of protons and neutrons. Flux is the number of signals per second per units sum of angle per square meters per billion electrons. 
AMS is an international collaboration. The detectors was constructed in Europe and Asia, so the detectors really is not made in the United States, it is made by the Europeans and the Asians. 
The sample was tested at the European Organization for nuclear research, and European space agency. But this is not a NASA experiment. During the construction, many visitors, a particular notice is Stephen Hawking, who I have known for many years, and he came with eleven nurses and spent an afternoon with me. And also, Elon Musk came one time to see how we do such complicated experiments in space. 
So let me share with you the detector: the Transition Radiation Detector where electrons or positrons because they have small mass and they reach the speed of light really quickly - within a second. 
This detector is mostly made in Germany, and this is a group of German physicists. On the top right corner are two professors that worked with me for more than 40 years. I known this group there are too many good physicists, and this detector has 5248 tubes. 
These tubes is 2 meters large and filled with xenon and CO2 the center is 100 micrometers. How do you center such a thing with such accuracy? One of my collaborators (the tallest one in class) was the dean of science at the university, so if you visit a nice university hospital you can use the CAT machine to scan all the tubes, so 9000 tubes were made, 5000 were selected. 

So, there's a national effort from Germany working with me from Auchen, from Karlsruhe, from Munchen institute (they have very precise machine shop), and this on the lower left is a picture of the four astronauts that recently come to visit. 

The Magnet. The best permanent magnet material is in Mongolia, which is part of China. And therefore this magnet was made by the Chinese space agency. Because nobody has ever put a magnet in space, so we made 10 magnets. 
7 magnets to make sure the magnet has no torque, has no field leakage and can be constructed without iron. And so the magnetic field comes from two closed loops, therefore looking from outside, all the fields cancels each other, and therefore it does not rotate, and there has no field leakout, so the astronaut can be near the magnet. 
I found out that the astronauts’ life supporting system switches itself off at 60 gauss, and this would be unfortunate if you have field leakout. 

And why without iron? For the weight? 

There is no iron, because all the fields are inside, so you don’t need to trap the field. 

The three full size magnets were made, one has to do with space qualification, you need acceleration, vibration to simulate space. Another one is to do a destructive test, to understand at which point the magnet will fall apart.
