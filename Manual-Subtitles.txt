On the left side, is the transition radiation detector, followed by nine-layer of silicon tracker, followed by electromagnetic calorimeter, and then rain imaging cherenkov called RICH, a magnet, and then time of flight detector. 
In total, a third of a million electronic channels, 650 fast microprocessors, and this would develop specially by the laboratory of nuclear science of MIT. It has a dimension of 5 meters by 4 meters by 3 meters. It weighs 7.5 tons. 

The detectors can be broken into 5 classes. Each class, if you look horizontally, goes through the different particles, with different trace. So, each particle is identified five times, for whatever redundance. 
So If you look vertically, the electron, also TRD, flight tracker, these you don’t need to know, but if this trace proton ion positron, antiproton, antihelium, all these different traces. 
You measure the momentum, the units are billion electronvolt. Charge is the location and the periodic table, or the number of protons in the nucleus. Rigidity is a special term used in space, means momentum per unit charged. 
Energy, E: billion electron volts per number of protons and neutrons. Flux is the number of signals per second per units sum of angle per square meters per billion electrons. 
AMS is an international collaboration. The detectors was constructed in Europe and Asia, so the detectors really is not made in the United States, it is made by the Europeans and the Asians. 
The sample was tested at the European Organization for nuclear research, and European space agency. But this is not a NASA experiment. During the construction, many visitors, a particular notice is Stephen Hawking, who I have known for many years, and he came with eleven nurses and spent an afternoon with me. And also, Elon Musk came one time to see how we do such complicated experiments in space. 
So let me share with you the detector: the Transition Radiation Detector where electrons or positrons because they have small mass and they reach the speed of light really quickly - within a second. 
This detector is mostly made in Germany, and this is a group of German physicists. On the top right corner are two professors that worked with me for more than 40 years. I known this group there are too many good physicists, and this detector has 5248 tubes. 
These tubes is 2 meters large and filled with xenon and CO2 the center is 100 micrometers. How do you center such a thing with such accuracy? One of my collaborators (the tallest one in class) was the dean of science at the university, so if you visit a nice university hospital you can use the CAT machine to scan all the tubes, so 9000 tubes were made, 5000 were selected. 

So, there's a national effort from Germany working with me from Auchen, from Karlsruhe, from Munchen institute (they have very precise machine shop), and this on the lower left is a picture of the four astronauts that recently come to visit. 

The Magnet. The best permanent magnet material is in Mongolia, which is part of China. And therefore this magnet was made by the Chinese space agency. Because nobody has ever put a magnet in space, so we made 10 magnets. 
7 magnets to make sure the magnet has no torque, has no field leakage and can be constructed without iron. And so the magnetic field comes from two closed loops, therefore looking from outside, all the fields cancels each other, and therefore it does not rotate, and there has no field leakout, so the astronaut can be near the magnet. 
I found out that the astronauts’ life supporting system switches itself off at 60 gauss, and this would be unfortunate if you have field leakout. 

And why without iron? For the weight? 

There is no iron, because all the fields are inside, so you don’t need to trap the field. 

The three full size magnets were made, one has to do with space qualification, you need acceleration, vibration to simulate space. Another one is to do a destructive test, to understand at which point the magnet will fall apart.

from 16 countries in over 60 companies and institues from around the world. This involved the development of hundreds of thermal, structural, and electrical components that integrated the AMS experiment with the space shuttle and ISS. Then it was shipped to the Kennedy space center for launch in 2011. All the intricate particle detectors had to be designed for the violet launch conditions in the space shuttle, and years in the harsh environment of space. With over 300,000 data channels, the AMS is the most complex experiment launched. While Mission success is primarily the responsibility of Professor Ting and the AMS corroboration, we all share a common goal to be sure the experiment transmits accurate data to the MS operations and payload control center at CERN. The original AMS mission was only supposed to last three years, however with such compelling science results, NASA has agreed to continue the AMS mission until the ISS is decommissioned. One of the many tasks we analyzed and simulated extensively was how to get AMS from the payload bay of the space shuttle to its final location on the ISS trust. This took months of development and simulations like the graphics you see here, which are shown at much higher speed than actual. We are all very pleased to see it work out just the way we had simulated it. Again, this flight video is significantly sped up. Within a few hours of installation on the ISS starboard trust, the AMS was gathering science data. 

So, after they installed AMS, I had a conversation with (unintelligible), and I read some prepared statements written by my wife, and I remember the first time (unintelligible), how come you are upside down? And he said, no, you are upside down. They explained to me how they managed to take the detector from the space shuttle to install it on the space station. So, AMS data links, you can see the ISS, the space station then go through (unintelligible), go through White Sands, go through Marshal Space Center, go to the MS control room (unintelligible) at CERN. At night, we have a control center in Taiwan, for part of the detectors. This is a picture during the daytime, and a picture in the early morning. So every 93 minutes, it will rotate the earth once. So this is an article in Scientific American that describes AMS. Ten years later, we have collected close to 200 billion signals. On the left is the front view and on the right is the side view of the signal. One curious result is the origin of positrons. So I measured 1.9 million positrons from (unintelligible) thousand billion electrons. There are not many positrons that come from cosmic ray collisions that they (unintelligible) grey area. (unintelligible) we do not know where they come from. It cannot the explained by existing theories. And therefore it could only come from dark matter or come from new physics. It cannot be explained by existing knowledge. Positron from dark matter. We know 90% of the universe is invisible. Because it is invisible, we call it dark matter. On the left is a galaxy seen by telescope, and on the right is the galaxy if you could see the dark matter. The dark matter model indeed agree with (unintelligible), but the error at high energy is still to large to make a definitive statement. But this is one of the very important confirmations on possible existence of dark matter origin. One of the reasons we want to continue collecting data is so the error becomes smaller so we can pin down the origin. And now for the surprising results is the cosmic nuclei. In 10 years we have measured 15 elements. In the next 10 years we will change the detector and measure the other 14 elements. Since cosmic ray discovery in 1912 by Victor Hess, it took more than a 100 years to actually measure all the cosmic ray elements. Cosmic rays are two causes. Primary cosmic rays, they come from explosions, nuclear fusion in stars. They are accelerated by the explosion of stars such as proton, helium, carbon, oxygen, and so forth.
